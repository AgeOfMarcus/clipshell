# ClipShell

I have no clue why I even made this, it was mainly for fun and one specific use case where I wanted to use the command line in school for fun but the teacher was able to see my screen so now I can use the command line from anything basically.

# Usage

Run it in the background then navigate wherever. Try it in a text editor first.

Write "clipshell::" followed by the command you want to be executed. Eg: "clipshell::ps -aux"

Copy it to the clipboard. Now paste and the result should be the output of running that command.

Easy as that.
